## Code to make brain visualisations

To run surf_schaef2.mat, download the relevant labels and surface files.
You also need to have the **"gifti"** function which is easiest to set up by downloading **[SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)**.

To run surf_cbm.mat, the same dependencies are needed as surf_schaef2.mat

To run subcort_plot.mat, you need to first download the **[ENIGMA Toolbox](https://enigma-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**.

custom().mat is the function used to choose the colours/colormap, however you can ignore this and use your own colourmap by specifying as the 3rd argument for surf_schaef2.mat, surf_cbm.mat.
